Conclusion 
From the Given interpretation we can conclude that both algorithm are 
not useful for random data file but this condition arises rarely in real life
since data would always be in some kind of pattern hence in such case LZW 
would be algorithm of choice as it is faster than huffman and compressed file
is also smaller.
