//reading from file: 
// read file and count frequency

// Huffman :
// make the heap of that frequency TODO: write heap ADT for node
// extrating node from heap build huffman tree
// count the lenght of each pattern
// count the occurences of each length
// convert pattern into canonical huffman code

//writing to file:
//write header
//write the occurences of each length 
//write end of the file
